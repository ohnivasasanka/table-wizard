#Table Wizard
##Data Arrangement Tool

Table Wizard allows you to create customized tables based on your criteria, handling two types of data: numbers and strings.

You can adjust the appearance of specific data types by setting conditions such as quotas or ranges.
Example: "I want the number 5 to appear exactly 2 times in my table."

Additionally, you can control how neighboring cells interact.
Example: "I don't want the number 1 next to the number 2."

Status: Under development.
